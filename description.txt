Title: Haunt Play

Description: 

Enter the world where fear becomes fun.
HauntPlay is a hauntingly immersive offline party game that brings chilling challenges, creepy storytelling, and thrilling deception into one unique experience — all on a single device.

Whether you’re sitting around a candlelit table or playing in a dark room with friends, HauntPlay will test your bravery, your imagination, and your ability to lie… or survive.


Three Ways to Play:


Dare or Curse
- A terrifying twist on the classic Truth or Dare. Choose wisely between revealing your darkest secrets, completing eerie challenges, or surrendering to a cursed task. Each round pulls you deeper into the unknown.


Ghost Circle
- One device. One room. Multiple souls. Take turns writing ghost stories, then read and rate each other’s tales. Who will summon the most frightening narrative? Only the bravest survive the final vote.


Haunted Spy
- One player is not who they seem… they’re a ghost. The others? Innocent, confused, and vulnerable. Uncover the liar by asking questions, observing behavior, and casting your vote before the spirit vanishes into the night.




Dare to enter. Stay to play. Try to escape.
HauntPlay — where nightmares become the game.
